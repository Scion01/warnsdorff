# the solution has been attempted in both ruby and c++


### the c++ has two solns: backtracing and warnsdorff's, backtracking is not feasible for larger problem space(it does work for size above 7, seg faults)


### to run the ruby solution, u can just execute the script inside lib/ as  ruby warnsdorff.rb and enter the initial coords eg: 0 0


### btw, if u want more details about other variables then i would suggest to run it via console, irb-> load 'warnsdorff.rb'-> Warnsdorff.new


### for the cpp solution, just run it as g++ <filename> and give the same input
